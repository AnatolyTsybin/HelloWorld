Some Scheme internal procedures

(= m n)         Tests whether the exact numbers m and n are equal
(< m n)         Tests whether m is less than n
(<= m n)        Tests whether m is less than or equal to n
(> m n)         Tests whether m is greater than n
(>= m n)        Tests whether m is greater than or equal to n
(abs n)         Gives the absolute value of n
    Examples: (abs 3) => 3 and (abs -3) => 3
(ceiling n)     Gives the smallest integer (inexact) which is >= n
    Examples: (ceiling 4.2) => 5.0 and (ceiling -4.2) => -4.0
(floor n)       Gives the largest integer (inexact) which is =< n
    Examples: (floor 4.2) => 4.0 and (floor -4.2) => -5.0
(round n)       Rounds n to the nearest integer (inexact).
                If n is exactly halfway between two integers,
                it rounds it the nearest even integer.
(truncate n)    Gives the integer (inexact) obtained by chopping off
                the decimal part of n
(expt n k)      Raises n to the power k
(sqrt n)        The square root of n, n >= 0
(max n...), (min n...)  The maximum and minimum of n..., respectively
(exp n), (log n)    The exponential of n and logarithm of n to the base e
(sin n), (cos n)    The trigonometric sine and cosine of n radians
(asin n), (acos n)  The arc sine and arc cosine of n
(tan n), (atan n)   The tangent and arc tangent of n
(quotient n k)      The quotient of n divided by k
(remainder n k)     The remainder of n divided by k with the sign of the dividend
(modulo n k)        The remainder of n divided by k with the sign of the divisor
